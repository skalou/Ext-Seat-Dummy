# Ext-Seat-Dummy

This Ext-Seat-Dummy mod for kerbal space program adds a Fake kerbonaut made of a cutting-edge material (probably from UK). With an acurate mass, CoM, drag and buoyancy it can aid design or balance crafts. For a more precise aerodynamic you need to surface attach it. Warranty void if exposed to vibrations or sunlight, but whatever, i know you will forget to remove it before flights...
